### THE SETUP
The first few steps we are going to need to do is create a new folder in our mods folder and create a new metadata file inside of it. In this case let’s go with the name firstObject.  

Now you can either make your own image and follow along or use an image from vanilla files and try to interpret the changes yourself.  

If you wish to try and create your own graphic the requirements are:  
- The image editor must export the file as a PNG with a transparency layer.
- Smallest visible block in Starbound is 8 x 8 pixels.
- The player character is about 24 x 32 pixels ( though the actual frame is 43 x 43 )  

Don’t feel like you need to create an amazing piece of art as that is what discourages most new modders feeling their work is not good enough. Just make something passable and either you will eventually get better – or someone may help you out in the future. But don’t wait till it’s perfect or your mod will never be made.

As you can see – even a professional artist such as Jim Davis had a very humble beginning for Garfield.  

So do not worry too much about how your first art piece looks like either. Over time it will prove as you refine it and get more skill.  

A few tips:

- The object dimensions should be based on a factor of 8.
- If you are making an object such as a table to place things on make sure there are no empty pixels within a factor of 8 above the table. For example a table only 14 pixels high will result in objects in game floating 2 pixels above it.
- You can have objects in other dimensions – but it will result in items not lining up properly time to time. Though you can define custom collision parameters manually but that is an advanced topic. See Outpost Stores or some farmables for an example of how it’s done in the vanilla game.
