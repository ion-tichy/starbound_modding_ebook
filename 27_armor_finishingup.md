### FINISHING IT UP
Now that you have a complete idea behind the armor â€“ make sure you add the appropriate recipe files and have some method of learning it ( for example through player.config ).

Now to give you an example of the importance of the item name over file name. Take a look at the player.config in the example mod in the download link provided. You will notice the item name and file name of the recipe are different. Yet in the player.config file we only wrote the actual item name. I did this only to stress the importance the actual item name must be used.
