### CLOSING REMARKS
If this book has helped you get into modding, please remember if you learn something new try and share it with the community. Sharing what you learn is the best way to support community growth, especially for those who are multi lingual, foreign language tutorials are nearly nonexistent..

If you make a mod and have read this book, feel free to drop me a line on my Profile Page, http://community.playstarbound.com/members/the-suit.12375/ - I always love to see what people make.

Till Next Time.
