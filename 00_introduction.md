# UNOFFICIAL STARBOUND MODDING EBOOK 2.0

FOR VERSION: STARBOUND 1.0
- - -
### EDITOR’S NOTE
Welcome to Version 2.0 of the Unofficial Starbound Modding Ebook..
### INTRODUCTION:
Welcome!  
Some of you may be apprehensive at first thinking it might be too difficult to learn
modding because you have no experience in coding or that you are either too young or too old to start 
You should dismiss such notions now, as modding in Starbound is not only easy it requires absolutely
no prior experience in coding what so ever.  
  
A large majority of Starbound modding deals with simply defining values to parameters. 
```lua  
{
    "name" : "example",
    "price": 11
}
```  

As you can see from the example above all which is being done is giving a value to each parameter. You
can create 80-90% of all items in Starbound through such simple steps.  

For the rest of you who has some experience in coding, Starbound also supports Lua scripting in items,
weapons, NPC’s and objects. It also has a Script Canvas API allowing you to create custom GUI
interfaces and even more complex interactions.  

One important thing to note is, this E-book is nowhere near exhaustive or complete. I am simply writing
it since I enjoy sharing knowledge with the community. I write this on my free time and updates may be
sparse and long between. But if you follow the mod page on alerts, you will be made aware when it is
updated. I encourage other users to write their own variations of tutorials as multiple perspectives is
always better than one.  

On a final note the <span style="color:orange;">reference</span> at the end of the book is there to help provide a little more detail on various aspects covered in the tutorials.

IT IS STRONGLY ADVISED YOU MANUALLY TYPE THE CODE AND NOT COPY AND PASTE.
