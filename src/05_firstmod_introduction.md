## YOUR FIRST MOD
### INTRODUCTION
By now you should have unpacked your assets, downloaded the required tools, and have a basic understanding of JSON. If you have missed out on any of those things, please go back to the appropriate section and complete it before moving on.  

Right click on Starbound in Steam Library -> Properties -> Local Files (tab) -> Browse Local Files.  

At this point it should have opened your Starbound directory inside there you will see a mods folder.  
Open that and create a new folder and name it *firstMod*.
