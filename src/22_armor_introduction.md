### MAKING YOUR OWN ARMOR

As always I am not going to repeat over areas covered in the earlier tutorials. So please do not skip to this area without finishing the previous ones. Making armor is only slightly more difficult than making acustom object. The most complicated part is setting up the assets properly. So if you are confident in using an image editor program you should be fine.

### INTRODUCTION

Now before we begin – make sure you setup a new mod folder with the _metdata file as we did previously. I am going to follow the vanilla file structure and follow items \ armors.  
Once we have the folder structure set up and metadata file written out. Go to your unpacked directory and go to:
```
  \unpacked\items\armors\biome\tar\tar
```

Because of the way the tar armor set is designed to essentially look like a blank canvas humanoid we can easily use it as a canvas for our own custom armor, but before we jump into image editing we need to modify the JSON files so we do not accidently get duplicate item errors later on. Also as Tar is essentially a cosmetic item – we will need to make some modifications in order to turn it in to an actual armor. With that said – if you just want to make a cosmetic item you can just edit the tar files without adding the extra bits for armor.

So for now the first step is to copy all the tar files over into our new armor mod folder.
