### THE PIXEL ART
I am not going to do anything special for the sake of the tutorial. I am going to make a simple square  but on purpose I am going to make it 22 pixels high and 24 pixels wide.  

*<insert image of gradient square>*

The cube I made above is a canvas size of 24 x 24 but 2 pixels on top are left blank. The importance of this will be explained soon as the issues this could cause when it deals specifically with stacking and tables.

Let us put this file in:

Though to be clear since we are making a custom object it is not necessary to place it in the object folder. Since it is a custom object you can follow any folder directory structure you wish, maintaining parallel directory structure is only important when modifying vanilla files. I am simply doing it this way for sake of good practice to follow for beginner users
