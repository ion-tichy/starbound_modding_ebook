### HELMETS
Helmets get their own special section because they have one feature other armors pieces do not, the mask file. While the helmet acts similar to other armor parts in that it just overlaps whatever is underneath, the helmet does one extra step and completely hides the “hair” part of the character. The hair part is in quotes because some users have gotten pretty creative with the hair parameter of their custom races.  

The mask file though allows the hair to be shown through the helmet. Let us take a look at the example image below.

*<insert example image>*

- The first frame – has no helmet
- The second frame – has the helmet but the mask file is empty.
- The third frame – has a mask for the upper layer, allowing her hair to be shown through.

The mask dimensions is the size of a single frame.

When making a mask there are only 2 colors which are allowed – pure black and pure white. Using black allows any element in that area to peak through, while white blocks it.
