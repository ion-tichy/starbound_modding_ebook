### A FEW SMALL POINTS ON NAMING
The way you name your files and objects is important for 2 major reasons.  

1. To easily identify the errors of items associated with your mod found in the starbound.log
2. To prevent incompatibility with other mods who may end up using the same name for an item.

Now in Starbound there are actually 2 names associated with each item. One name is the name
displayed to the player most commonly references as the “shortDescription” the other is the name only
referenced by the game engine or more commonly known as “itemname” or “objectname”.

A good practice for a naming style is using the name of your mod then the item name for example if we
made a mod called Black Sheep we could name an item.
```
“itemname” : “bsheep_wool”
```
This would clearly tell any modder checking out the starbound.log which mod that item is associated to.
