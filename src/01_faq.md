### FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
##### DOES STARBOUND COME WITH ANY MODDING TOOLS?
Technically no, but Starbound does come with an asset unpacker and packer. These two tools allow you to unpack the vanilla assets and the packer allows you to pack your creation into a .pak file for quick and easy distribution. Chuckle Fish has released a modified Tiled Editor to allow you to quickly and easily create your own custom dungeons. Though you cannot use it to edit existing planet files.  
You can get more information about it here: http://starbounder.org/Modding:Tiled

##### IF THERE ARE NO MODDING TOOLS, HOW DO I MAKE A MOD?
Do not worry, that is what this book is for.

##### DO I NEED PRIOR PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE TO MAKE ANY STARBOUND MODS?
Starbound requires absolutely no prior programming experience to make majority of the mods.  
Without knowing any programming you can make things such as:  
Decorations, Armors, Weapons, Races, Modify Existing Status Effects, New Planets, Dungeons, Ingame Structures, and much more.

##### SO WHAT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DOES STARBOUND USE?
Starbound uses 2 languages for modding. For basic modding it uses JSON ( Javascript Oriented Notation ) which was shown to you previously. The other is Lua which allows you to have more advanced control of how objects function.

##### HOW DO I BEST UTILIZE THIS BOOK?
The best way to learn from this book is start from the first tutorial and continue on. The first two tutorials are very vital to learn the basics ( First Mod \ First Object ). The tutorials following those will not cover topics already covered. It is strongly advised you make the example mod alongside reading it.  
This will give you the confidence to make your own version of the object and item.
