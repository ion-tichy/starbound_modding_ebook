### TOOLS OF THE TRADE  

Before we start modding, there are few things we will need to do, the first of which is gathering the tool required to make basic mods.  

Currently and in the foreseeable future Starbound does not actually offer any tools besides a packer and unpacker tool for the assets. Though there is an optional 3rd party tool download for Dungeon Creation. But the primary tools required for modding the game need be acquired elsewhere, all of which are free and available for all platforms. Though it may not be the same tool for each platform.  
### CODE EDITOR
When it comes to a code editor there are a few basic requirements:  
```
The editor should stick to UTF-8 encoding format. 
You will want to avoid Word Document Processors such as Microsoft Word. 
These use special text characters not supported by the game.  
```  

Believe it or not that actually is the only requirement when it comes to a code editor. Any other features you desire is really up to you. A few recommendations though are:
  
#### Windows:
- Notepad ++ : https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
    - Notepad++ probably has the lowest learning curve and easiest to operate for new users.
- Sublime Text : http://www.sublimetext.com/2
    - Rich feature set. High learning Curve. Tons of plugins. Evaluation software with no time limit.
- Atom : https://atom.io
    - Atom is an open source completely hackable editor with many features similar to sublime.  

#### Mac:
- Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/2
    - Rich feature set. High learning Curve. Tons of plugins. Evaluation software with no time limit.
- Atom : https://atom.io
    - Atom is an open source completely hackable editor with many features similar to sublime.  

#### Linux:
- Sublime Text: https://www.sublimetext.com/2
    - Rich feature set. High learning Curve. Tons of plugins. Evaluation software with no time limit.
- Atom : https://atom.io
    - Atom is an open source completely hackable editor with many features similar to sublime.  

If you donâ€™t wish to download any software you are free to use something such as Microsoft Notepad which comes with windows. But you will be missing out on great features provided by the programs listed above.  

### PIXEL EDITOR
The next tool we need in our shed is a Pixel Editing tool though there are quite a few graphics editors out there we have a few requirements we need to full fill first:  
-  Must be able to export PNG files
-  Must support Transparency Layers
-  Must be able to do pixel based editing.  

Check the Useful Links at the end of the Book for tutorials on using the tools for Pixel Art.  
Again like pixel editors any added features are just benefits. A few good options are:
- GrapfX 2 - http://pulkomandy.tk/projects/GrafX2
    - A basic pixel editor available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Though not well documented and few tutorials exist. Good for advanced users who are confident in learning the ropes themselves.
- Gimp: http://www.gimp.org
    - Gimp is a Graphics Manipulation Package which is a general purpose tool with an extremely rich feature set and thousands of tutorials online. Though for more general users this may feel very overwhelming at first.
- Paint.Net http://www.getpaint.net/index.html
    - I personally have not used it, but a few users have recommended it from the community.
